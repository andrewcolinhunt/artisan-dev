    """Resolve lineage mappings into concrete source-target artifact pairs.

    Mappings carrying ``source_original_name`` are resolved against
    finalized output artifact names within the role named by
    ``source_role``. Mappings carrying ``source_artifact_id`` are used
    directly. The ``LineageMapping`` schema guarantees exactly one of
    those two fields is set.

    Args:
        lineage: Role-keyed lineage mappings from capture or user code.
        finalized_artifacts: Role-keyed finalized output artifacts.

    Returns:
        List of source-target pairs with role and group metadata.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If a ``source_original_name`` cannot be resolved
            against finalized outputs in the declared role.
