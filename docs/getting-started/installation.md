# Installation

This page covers installing Artisan and its dependencies and configuring your
editor.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Platform:** Linux (x86_64) or macOS (Apple Silicon)
- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) package manager (installs Python and all other
  dependencies for you)

---

## Install Artisan

```bash
# Install Pixi (if not already installed)
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

:::{tip}
Restart your terminal after installing Pixi so it appears on your `PATH`.
:::

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dexterity-systems/artisan.git
cd artisan

# Install all dependencies (Python 3.12, scientific stack, etc.)
pixi install
```

:::{note}
The first `pixi install` downloads Python and all dependencies, which may take
several minutes. Subsequent runs are fast.
:::

Verify the installation:

```bash
pixi run python -c "import artisan; print('Installation OK')"
```

You should see `Installation OK` printed to the terminal.

:::{tip}
**Contributors:** run `pixi run -e dev setup` once to register Graphviz layout
plugins and install pre-commit hooks. The hook suite (ruff, mypy, codespell,
blacken-docs, and supporting checkers) runs on every commit; the same suite
is enforced in CI. Customize via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
:::

:::{dropdown} What is Pixi?
Pixi is a project-scoped environment and task manager. Like `venv` or `conda`,
it creates an isolated environment — but Pixi also handles Python itself and
non-Python dependencies such as Graphviz from a single lockfile.
Each clone gets its own environment.

| Tool | Manages Python? | Manages system deps? | Project-scoped? |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| venv + pip | No | No | Yes |
| conda | Yes | Yes | No (shared envs) |
| uv | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Pixi** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** |

**Why Pixi for this project?** Artisan needs Graphviz alongside Python (plus
Node.js for documentation builds). Pixi resolves them from conda-forge and PyPI in one
lockfile (`pixi.lock`), so every contributor gets an identical environment
regardless of platform. See [Tooling Decisions](../contributing/tooling-decisions.md)
for the full rationale.

## Optional cluster runners

Artisan includes a native local process-pool runner and requires no orchestration
server. Install a runner provider only when the target infrastructure needs it.
For example, the separate `artisan-submitit` package supplies SLURM job-array
and intra-allocation runners while reusing the same Artisan execution contract.
Provider installation and cluster setup live with that package so a local
Artisan installation does not carry scheduler dependencies.

## Using Pixi day-to-day

See [Using Pixi](using-pixi.md) for a full guide to environments, tasks, shells,
and workspaces.

## IDE setup (VSCode)

### Python interpreter

Set the Pixi environment as your VSCode Python interpreter:

```bash
pixi run which python
# Example output: /home/user/artisan/.pixi/envs/default/bin/python
```

In VSCode: `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) → "Python: Select
Interpreter" → paste the path above.

### Jupyter kernel

Register the Pixi environment as a Jupyter kernel so notebooks use the correct
packages:

```bash
pixi run install-kernel
```

In VSCode: open a `.ipynb` file → click "Select Kernel" → choose **Artisan**.

### Kernel slowness (Pixi environments)

If your pixi Jupyter kernel takes 30+ seconds to start in VS Code, the
`Python Environments` extension (`ms-python.vscode-python-envs`) is likely the
cause. It doesn't recognize pixi as a known environment type and spends 30
seconds trying to activate it before timing out.

**Fix:** Uninstall the `Python Environments` extension (`ms-python.vscode-python-envs`)
in VS Code. The core Python extension works fine without it.

## Claude Code

Artisan ships with a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
configuration for AI-assisted development — scaffolding operations, building
pipelines, and writing docs. See [Using Claude Code](using-claude-code.md) for
setup and usage.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `pixi: command not found` | Pixi not on `PATH` | Restart your terminal, or add `~/.pixi/bin` to your `PATH` manually |
| Thread-spawn panic during `pixi install` | Too many threads on constrained node | `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4 pixi install` |
| `pixi install` is very slow | First run downloads Python + all deps | Expected on first install — subsequent runs are fast |
| `dot` / Graphviz errors in provenance graphs | Graphviz layout plugins not registered | Run `pixi run dot -c` to register plugins (normally handled automatically) |
| Jupyter kernel missing "Artisan" option | Kernel not registered | Run `pixi run install-kernel` and restart your notebook |
