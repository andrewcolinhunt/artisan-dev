"""Shared fixtures for storage-layer tests.

The ``backend_fs`` fixture parametrizes over ``["local", "s3"]`` so the
same test body runs against both backends without ``if step_runner == "s3":``
branching. S3 params skip cleanly when MinIO is unavailable (the
session-scoped ``minio_endpoint`` fixture in ``tests/conftest.py``
yields None on boot failure).

    Tests that use this fixture run twice — once against

    The ``s3`` param carries the ``s3`` resource marker so
    ``pixi run -e dev test-unit`` (``-m '... and not s3'``) collects
    only the local branch and never boots MinIO; the s3 branch runs
    under ``test-s3``. The marker is explicit on the param (not
    auto-derived) because ``s3_fs`` is resolved lazily via
    ``request.getfixturevalue`` — the local-only run never
    instantiates MinIO via testcontainers, and lazy resolution is
    invisible to the fixture closure the auto-marker inspects.
