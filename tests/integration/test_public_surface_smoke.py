"""Public surface smoke — round-trip using only the package-level imports.

Existing integration tests reach into internal modules
(``from artisan.orchestration.runners import Runner``,
``from artisan.orchestration.pipeline_manager import PipelineManager``)
because they were written that way historically. That makes them
behavior tests but NOT public-surface tests — a forgotten re-export
on ``artisan.orchestration.__init__`` would slip through.

This file imports ONLY from ``artisan.orchestration`` (the public
package) and runs a complete pipeline. If ``__all__`` advertises a
name that isn't actually accessible, or a name in ``__all__`` resolves
to None, this file fails.
